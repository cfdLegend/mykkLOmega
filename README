Notes:
-----
There are 4 branches for different versions of OpenFOAM / Foam-extend
- master: this one should be compatible with OF 2.1 and later
- foam-extend-3.0: this one should be compatible with foam-extend (but I didn't tested it yet)
- OpenFOAM-2.1: this one is the OF-2.1-only version (superseded by master branch)
- devel: version used for model development

devel branch:
-------------
