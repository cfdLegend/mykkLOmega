kkLOmega model for openfoam
===========================

compilation:

wmake libso

testcase in T3A:

run with 
unset FOAM_SIGFPE

Notes:
-----
The standard k-kl-omega model was finaly corrected in OpenFOAM 2.3.x and now it is almost identical to baseline mykkLOmega model. Therefore you are advised to use the model from OpenFOAM 2.3.x.

Nevertheless the development of pressure-gradient sensitive version continues on pohlhasen and devel branches.
